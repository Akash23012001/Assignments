    <br><br>
    <div><b>A</b>way from his hometown, Ankit Nagwanshi from Chhindwara, Madhya Pradesh, was living the routine life of a software engineer
         in Mumbai. He worked a 9-5 job and spent several hours commuting to and from work. Working as a business intelligence 
         professional for a private firm in the city, Ankit had a well-paying job of Rs 8 lakh a year. But for four years, the 
         search for something different followed him everywhere.</div>
    <div>
        He always knew he wanted to do something in food. During his free time from work, he spent hours researching ideas 
        that would help him enter the food business. By 2019, Ankit was tired of the daily 13-kilometer commute, and the
         routine he was living. On August 15 that year, he quit and returned to Chhindwara.
    </div>
    <div>
        In 2021, his life is different altogether. The 30-year-old is no longer struggling to clock in his work hours.
         Instead, he runs a tea business, has hired two employees, and is earning an income of around Rs 60,000 a month.
          This change, he says, was not circumstantial, but one that came around because of the choices he made.
    </div>
    <div><pre>His venture, Engineer Chaiwala, has brought him immense satisfaction and pride.</pre></div>

    <div>Ankit had planned to start his own restaurant after quitting, but did not have the means or experience to run it.
         To start small, he began a tea business.
    </div>
    <div>
        “In India, tea is consumed by almost everyone, and multiple times a day. I thought it was a lucrative opportunity, 
        and one that required less investment. If I succeeded in the tea business, I could expand and eventually experiment
         in other food segments,” Ankit tells The Better India.
    </div>
    <div> 
        Ankit had lost his parents a few years ago. He talked about his decision to quit and start selling tea with his 
        sister and other family members, but the conversation did not go well.
    </div> 
    <div>
        His sister Roshni says, “We knew he wanted to start a business. He would constantly research potential options. 
        However, his idea of selling tea was difficult for us to digest. It was a tough decision for him too, but we 
        decided to support him anyway.”</div>
    <h2>From different corners of India</h2>

        <center><pre>Engineer Chaiwala has become popular among customers.</pre></center>
    <div>
        To compete with the other tea vendors in town, Ankit decided to bring uniqueness to his tea. “I travelled around India,
         including Jaipur, Pune, Amritsar and Delhi, to learn about different teas and the process of brewing them. Making tea
          is not rocket science, but the business model must be robust enough to sell varieties that are unique, so that customers
           remain loyal and come back for more. I realised that the desi tea, infused with ginger, tulsi, pudina and other herbs, 
           was popular among customers. I decided to make a masala (spices and herbs) blend with secret ingredients. After 
           perfecting the mix, I launched my business on 14 August 2020,” he says. He adds that the tea is brewed by adding 
           ingredients in a specific order. The precise brewing time ensures the ingredients infuse, which helps bring out the 
           tea’s best flavours.</div>
